Laravel Lumen is a stunningly fast PHP micro-framework for building web applications with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Lumen attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as routing, database abstraction, queueing, and caching.

## Setup

env setting

```shell script
cp .env.example .env
```

start server

```shell script
php -S localhost:8000 -t public
```

database migrate

```shell script
php artisan migrate
```

check route

```shell script
php artisan route:list
```
